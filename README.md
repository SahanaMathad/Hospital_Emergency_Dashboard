# Hospital_Emergency_Dashboard
A data visualization project built using SSMS and SSRS to analyze hospital emergency incidents and capacity utilization.

# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Incident Dashboard

### Transforming Hospital Data into Life-Saving Insights 🚑

This project demonstrates how SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) can be used together to analyze hospital emergency data, visualize trends, and provide actionable insights for better decision-making.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I designed and built an **interactive Hospital Emergency Dashboard** that tracks and analyzes hospital incidents such as emergency admissions, capacity utilization, and hospital-wise incident distribution.  

By combining **data extraction, transformation, and visualization**, this dashboard helps identify patterns and performance metrics across different hospitals — empowering administrators to make informed, data-driven decisions.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** – for querying, cleaning, and analyzing hospital data.  
- **SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)** – for designing interactive and visual dashboards.  
- **Microsoft SQL Server Database** – as the backend to store and manage hospital and incident data.  

---

## 📈 Key Features

- **Dynamic Visualization:** Interactive SSRS line charts showing hospital-wise incident counts.  
- **Automated Reporting:** Reports built using query-based datasets from SSMS.  
- **Customizable Views:** Ability to filter by hospital name, date, or incident type.  
- **Professional Dashboard Layout:** Clean and easy-to-understand presentation for hospital management teams.  

---

## 🧠 Learning Experience

Through this project, I learned to:
- Integrate **SSMS queries with SSRS datasets** to generate real-time insights.  
- Design **visual dashboards** using SSRS elements such as line charts, tables, and report parameters.  
- Troubleshoot issues like **missing axis data and dataset mapping errors** in SSRS.  
- Enhance data storytelling by turning raw SQL output into **meaningful visual insights**.

## 🏁 How to Run

1. Open the `.sql` files in **SQL Server Management Studio** and execute them to set up your database.  
2. Open the `.rdl` report in **SQL Server Report Builder** or **Visual Studio** with SSRS extensions.  
3. Connect the dataset to your SQL database.  
4. Preview the dashboard to view hospital-wise emergency incident insights.
